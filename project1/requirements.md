Emulate the photoshop file as a site:

- nav icons in top right should turn gray when you hover over them
- When you hover over the main nav items it should change color â€“ embedded within photoshop layers
- Drop shadows are important
- Chevrons need to be there, focus on details like rounded corners
- Gray task is the hover state
- You can export the charts as an image
- Ignore the hover tooltip
- Checkboxes need to work
